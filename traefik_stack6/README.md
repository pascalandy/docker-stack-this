Docs about `traefik_stack6` is a work in progress. Don't by shy to open an issue if you need help.

---

Based on `traefik_stack5`. It adds the ability to generate certificates using ACME by https://letsencrypt.org/.

You must understand how `traefik_stack5` runs. Then, it will be easy for you to run `traefik_stack6` on your own infra. I didn't test this on play-with-docker as ACME as rate limits.
