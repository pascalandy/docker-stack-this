# File or key used for certificates storage.
# WARNING, if you use Traefik in Docker, you have 2 options:
#  - create a file on your host and mount it as a volume
#      storageFile = "acme.json"
#      $ docker run -v "/my/host/acme.json:acme.json" traefik
#  - mount the folder containing the file as a volume

# WARNING, must point to an entrypoint on port 443
#
# Required

# Enable on demand certificate. This will request a certificate from Let's Encrypt during the first TLS handshake for a hostname that does not yet have a certificate.
# WARNING, TLS handshakes will be slow when requesting a hostname certificate for the first time, this can leads to DoS attacks.
# WARNING, Take note that Let's Encrypt have rate limiting: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits
#
# Optional
#
#onDemand = true

# Enable certificate generation on frontends Host rules. This will request a certificate from Let's Encrypt for each frontend with a Host rule.
# For example, a rule Host:test1.traefik.io,test2.traefik.io will request a certificate with main domain test1.traefik.io and SAN test2.traefik.io.
#
# Optional
#
# OnHostRule = true

# CA server to use
# Uncomment the line to run on the staging let's encrypt server
# Leave comment to go to prod
#
# Optional
#
# caServer = "https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"

# Domains list
# You can provide SANs (alternative domains) to each main domain
# All domains must have A/AAAA records pointing to Traefik
# WARNING, Take note that Let's Encrypt have rate limiting: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits
# Each domain & SANs will lead to a certificate request.
