## Introduction
This project will run those services (Traefik, Portainer, Nginx, Caddy, Whoami, WordPress) in one simple copy-paste command:

#### Anything special about this mono repo?
- This stack does not use ACME (TLS).
- I decided to work on this as I still have issues in the project `traefik-manager` which use ACME. 

## Time to deploy
1. Go to http://labs.play-with-docker.com/ 
2. Create **one instance** and wait for the node to provision
3. On **node1**, copy paste:

```
# Create Swarm
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0; docker node ls;

# Install common apps
apk update && apk upgrade && apk add nano curl bash git wget unzip ca-certificates;

# Clone repo
cd /root;
git clone https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this.git;
cd docker-stack-this;

# Select a branch 
git checkout 1.18;

# Go to the actual project
cd traefik-manager-noacme; echo; pwd; echo; ls -AlhF;

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x runup; chmod +x rundown; chmod +x runctop;

# Run the stack
./runup;
```

This is it!!! Now it’s time to…

## Confirm that Traefik and the gang are running
1. The script `runup` does the hard work for us.

2. When you see that all services are deployed, click on `80` to see a static landing page.

3. From the same URL generated by play-with-docker, in the address bar of your browser, add `/who1/` or `/who2/` or `/portainer/` to access other services.

#### Example
```
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who1/
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who2/
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/portainer/
```

**WARNING**! Portainer requires a slash `/` at the end of the path. There is something to tweak with Traefik Labels in order for it to accept the proxy the request without the slash `/` at the end.

#### Web apps details:
- **/** = [caddy](https://hub.docker.com/r/abiosoft/caddy/)
- **who1/** = [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)
- **who2/** = [whoami](https://hub.docker.com/r/emilevauge/whoami/)
- **portainer/** = [portainer](https://hub.docker.com/r/portainer/portainer//)
- **wordpress/** = [wordpress](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/)

There is an [issue](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/issues/8) about wordpress.

#### All commands
In the active path, just execute those bash-scripts:

- `./runup`
- `./rundown`
- `./runctop`

See for yourself that Wordpress data is persistent even after shutting down services.

#### Bonus
`runctop` runs as a simple docker run to see the memory consumed by each services.

#### What is Traefik?
[Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/backends/docker/) is a powerful layer 7 reverse proxy. Once running, the proxy will give you access to many web apps. I think this is a solid use cases to understand how this reverse-proxy works.

#### Traefik version 
In `toolproxy.yml` look for something like `traefik:1.4.0-rc3`.

## Backlog

Here is what’s missing to make this stack perfect?
 
- Secure traefik dashboard
- Use SSL endpoints (ACME)
- Fix the need to use a trailing slash `/` at the end of Portainer service

## Something is off? Please let me know.
I consider this README crystal clear. If there is anything that I could improve, please [let me know via an issue](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/issues).

## Shameless promotion :-p
Looking to **kick-start your website** (static page + a CMS) ? Take a look at [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) (another project I shared). It allows you to see and edit websites made with **Ghost**. In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign up! Just use the dummy email & password provided.

## Wanna help?
If you have solid skills 🤓 with Docker Swarm, Linux bash and the gang and you’re looking to help a startup to launch a solid project, I would love to get to know you.
