## Introduction

This docker stack will run many services (Traefik, Socat, Portainer, Nginx, Caddy, Whoami) in one simple copy-paste command. Please also refer the the [README](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repo.

## Start here
1. Go to http://labs.play-with-docker.com/ 
2. Create **one instance*. Wait for the node to provision
3. On **node1**, copy paste:

```
ENV_BRANCH=1.49
ENV_MONOREPO=traefik_stack5

# Setup alpine node and docker swarm

source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/master/play-with-docker-init/alpine-setup.sh) && sleep 2 && \
git checkout "$ENV_BRANCH" && \
cd "$ENV_MONOREPO" && \
./runup.sh;
```

The script `runup.sh` will do the hard work for us :) Once deployed, you will see: 


#### See your stacks

```
$ docker stack ls

NAME                SERVICES
toolmonitor         1
toolproxy           2
toolweb             3
```


#### See your services

```
$ docker service ls

```

## Confirm that your services (containers) are running
1. When you see that all services are deployed, click on `80` to see the static landing page.
2. From the same URL generated by play-with-docker, in the address bar of your browser, add `/who1/` or `/who2/` or `/portainer/` to access other services.


#### Example
```
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who1/
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who2/
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/portainer/
```

The container for the first URL is actually named `home`.


#### Web apps details:
- **/** = [caddy](https://hub.docker.com/r/abiosoft/caddy/)
- **/who1/** = [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)
- **/who2/** = [whoami](https://hub.docker.com/r/emilevauge/whoami/)
- **/portainer/** = [portainer](https://hub.docker.com/r/portainer/portainer/)

Portainer requires a slash `/` at the end of the path. There is something to tweak with Traefik Labels in order for it to accept the proxy the request without the slash `/` at the end.

#### Anything special about this mono repo?

- This stack does not use ACME (https://). ACME is a pain while developping … reaching limits, etc.
- If you don’t want to use socat, checkout the monorepo `traefik-manager-noacme`

## All commands
In the active path, just execute those bash-scripts:

- `./runup.sh`
- `./rundown.sh`
- `./runctop.sh`

**Bonus!** `./runctop.sh` is not a stack but a simple docker run to see the memory consumed by each containers.


## What is Traefik?
[Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/backends/docker/) is a powerful layer 7 reverse proxy. Once running, the proxy will give you access to many web apps. I think this is a solid use cases to understand how this reverse-proxy works.


#### Traefik version 
In `toolproxy.yml` look for something like `traefik:1.5.0`.

In some mono-repo I **my own traefik image**. Feel free to use the official images. It will not break anything.


## Backlog
Here is what’s missing to make this stack perfect?
 
- Secure traefik dashboard
- Use SSL endpoints (ACME)
- Fix the need to use a trailing slash `/` at the end of Portainer service

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is… I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.


#### Hosting

Looking to **kick-start your website** (static page + a CMS) ? Take a look at [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) (another project I shared). It allows you to see and edit websites made with **Ghost**. In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign up! Just use the dummy email & password provided.

#### I’m looking for help

If you have solid skills 🤓 with Docker Swarm, Linux bash and the gang and you’re looking to help a startup to launch a solid project, I would love to get to know you. Buzz me 👋 on Twitter [@askpascalandy](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can see the things that are done and the things we have to do [here](http://firepress.org/blog/technical-challenges-we-are-facing-now/).

I’m looking for bright and caring people to join this [journey](http://firepress.org/blog/tag/from-the-heart/) with me.
