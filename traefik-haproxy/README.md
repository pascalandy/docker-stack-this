# Quickly try this stack

I consider this README crystal clear. It should be quick for you to try the elements of this repo. If there is anything that I could improve, please let me know. **Source**: https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this

**Why using a traefik + socketproxy**?
Listen to this: https://cl.ly/1z0Q3a0K1M15

## Setup

1. On http://labs.play-with-docker.com/ create five instances.
2. Wait about 30sec after node5 is deployed to ensure the machines have a network.

3. Execute: `./setup`. This will do 3 things:
- Create 3 leaders + 2 workers.
- Clone repo && cd into the right directory
- Execute: `./start`

Enjoy!

## Start and stop

Execute: `./start` and `./stop`

To see screen shots and each commands one by one, see [single_commands.md](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/blob/master/traefik-haproxy/single_commands.md)

## A last word

**P.S.** If you have solid skills 🤓 with Docker Swarm, Bash (and the gang)… plus you would love 💚 to help a startup to launch 🔥 a solid project, I would love to get to know you 🍻. Buzz me 👋 on Twitter [@askpascalandy](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). I’m looking for bright and caring people to join in this journey 🌇.

Here, I [shared the details](http://firepress.org/blog/technical-challenges-we-are-facing-now/) of the challenges I’m facing at the moment.

Cheers!
